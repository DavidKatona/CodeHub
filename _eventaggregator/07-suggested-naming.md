It’s recommended to name events based on the concept they represent. For instance, if creating an event to signify the 
death of a character, consider a name that clearly conveys this purpose, such as `OnCharacterDied` or `OnPlayerDied.`

It would also be beneficial to prefix your events with something that can be searched for easily in the content browser, 
for example `EBP_`. So for example, `EBP_OnCharacterDied`. *(EBP stands for Event Blueprint)*

Feel free to adjust naming conventions to your projects' needs!
